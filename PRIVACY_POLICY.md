## Privacy Policy

Jeffrey Bergier and Saturday Apps, the DEVELOPER, built the WaterMe, the APPLICATION, as an Open Source app. The APPLICATION is provided by the DEVELOPER to the USER at no cost and is intended for use as is and without any warranty.

The PRIVACY POLICY discloses details with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information, PII, by the APPLICATION.

By using the APPLICATION, then the USER agrees to this PRIVACY POLICY.

**Information Collection and Use**

The APPLICATION never collects PII. Information that the APPLICATION collects includes App Store receipts, when in-app purchases are made. These receipts are provided by Apple and do not contain PII. In-App Purchase receipts never leave the device.

The APPLICATION uses the Apple provided analytics and crash reporting services. These services are provided by Apple, are opt-in by the USER, and report no PII. To opt-out of this service, see this page: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202100.

The APPLICATION uses [MongoDB Realm Database](https://www.mongodb.com/realm/mobile/database) to store data locally on the device. The APPLICATION does NOT use [MongoDB Realm Sync](https://www.mongodb.com/realm/mobile/sync). Information entered into the APPLICATION never leaves the device. Information entered into the APPLICATION is protected by the lock screen on the device. The data can be accessed if the lock screen password is known. The USER is advised to never enter PII or sensitive data into the APPLICATION.

**Log Data**

The APPLICATION logs a SUMMARY of warnings and errors that occur within the APPLICATION to the local storage on the device. The SUMMARY that the APPLICATION creates does not contain any PII. The SUMMARY does contain the [IDENTIFIER FOR VENDOR](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uidevice/1620059-identifierforvendor). This identifier is NOT the same as IDENTIFIER FOR ADVERTISERS and CANNOT be used to track the USER across multiple apps or devices. 

A SUMMARY of the error may be sent to a dedicated email mailbox that only the DEVELOPER has access to. The SUMMARY is used to help the DEVELOPER understand errors that occur in the app so they can be resolved more quickly. The SUMMARY is never used for analytics and is never distributed to third parties. The SUMMARY does not contain any PII.

The SUMMARY is sent from the device using [Amazon AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [Amazon AWS Simple Email Service](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/) which delivers the SUMMARY to a dedicated mailbox stored in [Kolab Now](https://kolabnow.com) in Switzerland. The SUMMARY is purged after 6 months.

**Security**

The DEVELOPER values the privacy of the USER and has built the APPLICATION in a very specific way so that the DEVELOPER does not have access to the data of the USER. The APPLICATION does NOT use common analytics and data collection frameworks such as [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com), [Fabric Crashlytics](https://get.fabric.io), or [Segment](https://segment.com). Instead, the DEVELOPER built the SUMMARY send feature, mentioned previously, as a way to solve bugs in the APPLICATION without sacrificing the privacy of the USER or data of the USER.

**Childrenâ€™s Privacy**

The APPLICATION is not intended to be used by children under the age of 13. Do not, under any circumstances, enter information about children or any people into the APPLICATION. The APPLICATION is intended to store information about plants. The APPLICATION should not be used to store information about people.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

The DEVELOPER may update the PRIVACY POLICY from time to time. Thus, the USER is advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

**Contact**

To ask questions about the Privacy Policy, contact the DEVELOPER at support@saturdayapps.com.
