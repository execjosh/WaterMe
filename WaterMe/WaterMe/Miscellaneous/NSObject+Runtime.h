/**
There is no way to guarantee that an object you don't control will or won't be
KVC compliant for a given key ahead of time. However, this method attempts
to do some introspection to see if it COULD work.

1. Checks for a matching selector
2. Checks the properties of the class to see if one matches
3. Checks the Ivars of the class to see if one matches

It goes in the above order and if one matches then it returns YES.
If all tests fail, it returns NO
