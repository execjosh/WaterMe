     This is a workaround for some sort of bug in `UNUserNotificationCenter`
     If the user has too many days in a row of notifications,
     when I schedule them the center accepts the addition
     with no error, then later the notifications never come.

     This value was found experimentally on iOS 13 on iPhone X.
     I'm not sure if its the same on every device though.
     70 DOES NOT WORK
     60 WORKS
     Setting at 50 because it should give enough gap
     so that things remain reliable across many devices
     while still providing good value for users.
